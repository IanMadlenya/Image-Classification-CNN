1) In this experiment, we used the git repo - https://github.com/myleott/mnist_png to convert the mnist data into png files.
2) We used the already split into train-test data so that we can benchmark results.
3) We shuffled the training and testing dataset, so that the images of classes are randomized.
4) We used all 10 classes and all the data (60,000 train, 10,000 test)
